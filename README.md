# E-Library
An online Library Management website where teachers can upload books and students can read from the platform.
For the past two years, the world has been facing a major crisis in nearly every field because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Education is one such field that has been greatly affected by the pandemic. 
Students have witnessed the great shift of education from offline to online. 
But the problem lies in the fact that it's not possible for the majority of them to access the resources from college and university libraries physically. Besides, buying so many books is also not feasible for everyone.
So, this has led to a rise in the online education system. Most schools and colleges have shifted to online learning. E-Learning is the new normal.
However, we often see that it becomes difficult for the students to gain access to the required books due to the lack of resources or financial constraints.
In order to provide an efficient and useful solution to the problems discussed earlier, we aim to design an E-Library that can be used by colleges, 
universities and even individuals who would like to learn from a vast collection of books and resources
