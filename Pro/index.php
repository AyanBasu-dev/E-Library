				<p>For the past two years, the world has been facing a major crisis in nearly every field because of
					the COVID-19 pandemic. Education is one such field that has been greatly affected by the
					pandemic. Students have witnessed the great shift of education from offline to online. But the
					problem lies in the fact that it's not possible for the majority of them to access the resources from
					college and university libraries physically. Besides, buying so many books is also not feasible for
					everyone.</p><p>
					So, this has led to a rise in the online education system. Most schools and colleges have shifted
					to online learning. E-Learning is the new normal. However, we often see that it becomes difficult
					for the students to gain access to the required books due to the lack of resources or financial
					constraints.</p><p>In order to provide an efficient and useful solution to the problems discussed earlier, we aim to
					design an E-Library that can be used by colleges, universities and even individuals who would
					like to learn from a vast collection of books and resources.</p>
